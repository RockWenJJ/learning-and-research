Spatial As Deep: Spatial CNN for Traffic Scene Understanding
### 01. Authors
Xingang Pan, Jianping Shi, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang. CUHK, SenseTime
### 02. Background
Although CNN has shown strong capability to extract semantics from pixels, it's capability to capture spatial relationships of pixels across rows and columns is limited, which are important to learn semantic objects with strong shape priors but weak appearance coherences.

### 03. Contributions
Generalize deep layer-by-layer convolutions to slice-by-slice convolutions within feature maps, enabling message passing between pixel across rows and columns. 

Outperform SOTA methods

### 04. Implementation Details
(1) Computational efficiency

(2) Message as residual

(3) Flexibility

### 05. Questions
